 - The player has a limited boost that can be used with 'shift'
 - There are two modes for the player: the normal mode; where the movement is locked to the player's front, and the directional ship mode; where the player can freely move around screen with 'wasd'
 - The game has 3 types of enemies: shooter: who periodically shoots at the player, stalker: who constantly follows the player, and pulser: who shoots bullets in the form of a circle.
